# Ordination

 Sorting algorithms is a very basic and important algorithm in computational world.In big data era, is essential organize and sort every type of data  using fast and effective algorithms.In this repository you will find some of these algorithms.

## Language Implementation

I implemented the same sort algorithms in three different languages(Java,C++ and Python). The main objective of this, is explore the different characteristics of each language(pointers in c++,interfaces/abstract classes/polymorphism in Java and the fexibility of python) and fix algorithm idea of each sort algorithm.

### Algorithms

In this repository you will find the following data structures:

```

- BubbleSort
- SelectionSort
- InsertionSort
- MergeSort
- QuickSort
- QuickSort using median of three(optimization)
- GnomeSort
- CoutingSort(only in Java)

```

In each implementation file have some variations of algorithms (recursive,iterative, bidirectional,...)


## Tests

For validation test cases,has been used Junit for Java , Unittest for python and lboost for C++.
